        "narrative": "Q3 FY24 saw a sequential increase in average daily orders (8.7% to 5.8 million) and total orders (3.5% to 350 million), despite three fewer trading days. Gross broking revenue declined slightly (-2.6% to \u20B97.1 billion) due to a tariff structure change for intraday cash segment. Interest income grew substantially (17% to \u20B92.1 billion) due to increased client funding book and margin requirements. Overall gross revenue increased 17% sequentially to \u20B910.6 billion. PAT decreased 14.5% QoQ to \u20B92.6 billion driven by increased operating expenses, mainly due to higher client acquisition costs and technology investments.
