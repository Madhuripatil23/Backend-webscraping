Q4 revenue grew by 2.5% in constant currency, with all major markets showing sequential growth. Record Q4 TCV of $12.2 billion, reflecting market share gains, particularly in North America and BFSI. Operating margin for FY25 was 24.3%, a decline of 30 bps YoY, primarily due to wage increases and investments in infrastructure and capabilities. Net margin was 19%.",

Operating margin was 24.3%, a 30 bps decline YoY, driven by wage hikes and investments, partially offset by improved utilization and currency support. Net margin was 19%, and EPS grew 5.1% YoY.\n\nSuitable Charts:\n* Bar chart comparing FY25 revenue and profitability (INR, USD, CC growth %, operating margin, net margin) to FY24.\n* Line chart showing the trajectory of operating margins throughout FY25."

    "segment_geographic_deep_dive": "BFSI showed modest growth in Q4 and FY25, driven by modernization, cost optimization, and regulatory spend. Consumer Business saw caution and delays in discretionary projects, particularly in the US. Life Sciences \u0026 Healthcare faced client-specific challenges earlier in the year, but saw some recovery with vendor consolidation opportunities. Manufacturing experienced softness due to uncertainties in the auto industry. Technology \u0026 Services saw modest growth, driven by cost optimization and GenAI adoption. Communication \u0026 Media faced industry-specific challenges but saw improved growth in Q4 due to vendor consolidation and technology productivity initiatives. Energy, Resources and Utilities continued strong growth, driven by investments in advanced technologies. Regional Markets showed strong traction.\n\nGeographically, North America declined in Q4 but showed growth for the full year. Europe and UK showed modest growth. Growth markets like MEA, LatAm, and Asia Pacific continued to perform strongly, along with robust growth in India.",
    "deal_wins_pipeline_quality": "Record Q4 TCV of $12.2 billion, with no mega deals, indicates a healthy order book and strong deal pipeline.  North America and BFSI contributed significantly to TCV.  Deal durations are shorter, leading to faster revenue conversion.  No significant shift in deal mix between renewals and new deals, or between cost optimization and discretionary programs.  Management expressed confidence in the pipeline, driven by client prioritization of technology modernization, cost optimization, and other key initiatives.",
    "management_commentary_outlook": "Management acknowledges increased uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment, leading to delays in decision-making and pressure on discretionary spending.  However, they remain confident that FY26 will be stronger than FY25, particularly for international business, driven by strong TCV in the last two quarters and the expectation that current uncertainties are temporary. They also see growth potential in AI/GenAI and tech transformation initiatives. Management emphasizes the importance of perpetual adaptability and a technology-led approach to navigate the changing environment.  They are closely monitoring the global situation and remain committed to being a relevant partner for their clients.",
    "comparison_to_expectations": "While the company doesn\u0027t provide specific guidance, the 2.5% CC revenue growth in Q4 was slightly below initial expectations due to delays and deferrals in March. However, the strong TCV performance exceeded expectations.",

    "operational_efficiency": "DSO reduced by three days sequentially to 71 days. LTM attrition remained stable at 13.3%. Focus on improving utilization, productivity, and realization to offset wage hikes and investment costs.  Campus hiring program is progressing as planned, and the company is gearing up for increased campus hires in FY26.  Investments in organic talent development, particularly in AI/GenAI, are yielding positive learning outcomes."
