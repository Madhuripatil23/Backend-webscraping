    "performance_summary": "LTIMindtree reported strong FY23 results with 19.9% YoY CC revenue growth and 17.2% YoY USD revenue growth. Q4 FY23 revenue reached $1.06B, up 13.5% YoY in CC terms. EBIT margin for Q4 FY23 improved to 16.4%, up 250 bps QoQ. Order inflow for Q4 was $1.35B, leading to a full-year inflow of $4.87B. The company highlighted successful merger integration, robust performance amidst macro uncertainties, and expanded capabilities driving cross-sell/upsell opportunities.",
    "trend_analysis": {
      "latest_quarter": {
        "narrative": "Q4 FY23 revenue grew by 1% QoQ in USD terms and 0.7% in CC terms. YoY growth was strong at 11.9% in USD and 13.5% in CC. EBIT margin expanded significantly by 250 bps QoQ to 16.4%, driven by absence of furloughs, lower integration costs, and operational efficiencies. PAT margin also improved to 12.8% from 11.6% in Q3 FY23. Charts could depict these QoQ and YoY changes using bar charts for revenue and line charts for margins."
      },
      "full_year": {
        "narrative": "FY23 revenue showed robust growth of 19.9% YoY in CC and 17.2% in USD.  EBIT margin for FY23 was 16.2%, down from 17.8% in FY22, while PAT margin was 13.3%, down from 15.1%. The trajectory of operating margins throughout FY23 could be visualized using a line chart, potentially highlighting factors like merger-related costs and operational efficiencies impacting profitability."

    "segment_geographic_deep_dive": "BFSI performed well, growing 23% YoY in USD terms despite a challenging macro environment. High-Tech, Media, and Entertainment reached $1B in revenue, growing 14.5% YoY. North America remained the strongest market with 21.5% YoY growth, reaching $3B in revenue. Europe grew 14.1% YoY in CC but only 3.9% in USD due to forex impact. Some client-specific slowdowns and hiring freezes were noted, particularly in BFSI, impacting Q4 performance and potentially Q1 FY24.",
    "deal_wins_pipeline_quality": "The order book and deal pipeline appear healthy, with a total contract value (TCV) of $1.35B in new deals for Q4 and $4.87B for FY23.  Significant wins include onsemi, demonstrating LTIMindtree\u0027s ability to secure large transformation deals. While there are some delays in deal ramp-ups due to client caution and hiring freezes, the pipeline remains robust with a good mix of efficiency-driven deals and large deals in final stages, particularly in BFSI.",
    "management_commentary_outlook": "Management is optimistic about FY24, expecting double-digit revenue growth despite potential Q1 softness due to continued client caution. They highlight cross-sell/upsell opportunities and strong pipeline.  Macro uncertainties and client decision-making delays are acknowledged, but the focus is on long-term growth driven by robust order book and pipeline. Wage hikes are expected in Q2 FY24 but at a lower rate than previous years.",
    "comparison_to_expectations": "",
    "key_risks_headwinds": "Key risks include macro uncertainties, client caution in spending, delayed decision-making, and hiring freezes impacting deal ramp-ups.  Management also noted reduced consumer confidence impacting retail and CPG spending.",
    "operational_efficiency": "DSO improved slightly to 60 days in Q4. Utilization excluding trainees was 81.7%, slightly down QoQ. Attrition continued to trend lower at 13.7% quarterly annualized and 20.2% TTM. Headcount decreased slightly QoQ due to reduced lateral hiring during the merger integration.  The return-to-office program is progressing well, with new satellite offices aiding talent acquisition."
