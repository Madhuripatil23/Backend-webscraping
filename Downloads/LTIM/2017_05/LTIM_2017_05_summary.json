Profitability also improved, with EBIT margin expanding by 110 bps QoQ and PAT margin increasing by 30 bps QoQ.  FY17 EBIT margin stood at 18.3% and PAT margin at 14.6%.",

      "latest_quarter": {
        "narrative": "Q4 FY17 revenue showed growth of 3.6% QoQ (2.4% in CC) and EBIT margin expanded by 110 bps to 18.9%, driving a 30 bps increase in PAT margin to 14.7%.  A bar chart comparing Q3 and Q4 revenue, EBIT, and PAT would visually represent this growth. Line charts could depict the margin trends across quarters.\n\nYear-on-Year comparisons were not available for the latest quarter in the provided document."
      },
      "full_year": {
        "narrative": "FY17 saw strong revenue growth of 10% YoY (9.3% in CC terms).  EBIT margin improved from 17% in FY16 to 18.3% in FY17, while PAT margin also increased from 13.9% to 14.6%.  This suggests a positive trajectory in operating margins.  The document doesn\u0027t detail specific factors influencing the margin expansion, but bar charts comparing FY16 and FY17 revenues, EBIT, and PAT, along with line charts for margins, would effectively visualize the yearly performance trends."

The document highlights a diversified portfolio with increasing concentration towards larger clients (50 million dollar \u002B).  North America contributes the majority of revenue (close to 70%), followed by Europe and other regions.",
    "deal_wins_pipeline_quality": "The presentation highlights several key deal wins, including Project Insight by CBDT, an infrastructure deal with an international institution, an upstream applications portfolio management deal with a Fortune 10 energy corporation, and a cloud ERP transformation deal with a French transnational company.  No specific TCV figures or broader pipeline commentary are provided.",
