      "latest_quarter": {
        "narrative": "Q1 2025 net sales (INR 5930.4 cr) were marginally lower QoQ (vs. INR 6012 cr in Q4 2024) and nearly flat YoY (vs. INR 5936.5 cr in Q1 2024). EBIT (INR 370.7 cr) increased significantly QoQ (vs. INR 182 cr in Q4 2024) but decreased YoY (vs. INR 398.5 cr in Q1 2024). EBIT margin followed a similar trend at 6.3%, up from 3.0% in Q4 2024 but down from 6.7% in Q1 2024. PAT also followed this trend. A bar chart would effectively visualize the QoQ and YoY comparisons for revenue, EBIT, and PAT. Line charts could illustrate the margin trends over the quarters.\nThe drivers for these changes include lower sales volumes, improved sales mix leading to higher margins QoQ, and cost optimization initiatives contributing to higher profitability QoQ despite lower volumes."
