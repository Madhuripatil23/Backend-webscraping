    "performance_summary": "LTIMindtree reported strong Q2 FY24 and H1 FY24 results despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. Key highlights include robust revenue growth (5.2% YoY in USD terms for Q2), healthy order inflow ($1.3B in Q2, $2.7B in H1), and successful integration of the merged entities. EBIT margin was impacted by wage hikes but is expected to recover in H2 FY24.",
    "trend_analysis": {
      "latest_quarter": {
        "narrative": "Q2 FY24 revenue grew by 1.6% QoQ and 5.2% YoY in USD terms. EBIT margin decreased slightly QoQ to 16% due to wage hikes, but operational efficiencies partially offset this impact. PAT margin remained stable at 13.1%. YoY comparisons should be viewed with caution due to the merger."
      },
      "full_year": {
        "narrative": "H1 FY24 revenue grew by 6.6% YoY in USD terms. EBIT margin was 16.3%, and PAT margin was 13.1%. The company expects H2 FY24 to be stronger than H1 FY24, driven by robust order inflow and deal closures."
      }
    },
    "segment_geographic_deep_dive": "Manufacturing and Resources vertical showed strong growth (16.2% YoY in USD terms). BFSI grew 5.9% YoY in USD, while Hi-Tech, Media and Entertainment declined 1.3% YoY due to a higher base but grew sequentially. North America grew 6% YoY, and Europe showed strong growth at 10.2% YoY (both in USD terms).",
    "deal_wins_pipeline_quality": "Order book and deal pipeline remain healthy. The company is seeing a shift from discretionary spending to cost optimization, leading to larger, longer-tenure deals. Key deal wins include engagements with a semiconductor manufacturer, an apparel retailer, and an insurance and retirement major.",
    "management_commentary_outlook": "Management expects H2 FY24 to be stronger than H1 FY24, despite anticipated higher-than-average furloughs in Q3. They are confident in their ability to leverage the integrated entity to capitalize on market recovery and strengthen their industry position. The company is focused on achieving its long-term goal of becoming a $10B enterprise.",
    "comparison_to_expectations": "While specific comparisons to market expectations weren\u0027t provided, management expressed confidence in achieving their margin guidance of 17-18% by the end of FY24.",
    "key_risks_headwinds": "Key headwinds include macroeconomic uncertainties, cautious client spending, and higher-than-average furloughs expected in Q3. Geopolitical tensions also add to the uncertainty.",
    "operational_efficiency": "Utilization improved to 86.6%, and attrition decreased to 15.2%. Headcount additions will be aligned with business requirements and revenue growth. The company is focused on its margin improvement program and achieving operational efficiencies to offset headwinds."
