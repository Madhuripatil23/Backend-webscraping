Retail disbursements for FY25 were INR 60,040 Cr, up 11% YoY. The retail book grew 19% YoY to INR 95,180 Cr. Q4 PAT was INR 636 Cr, up 15% YoY.  Despite these positive results, the company faced challenges in the microfinance sector, particularly in Karnataka due to a new ordinance, and implemented a risk-calibrated disbursement strategy in certain segments.",

A bar chart could also illustrate this change.\nYear-on-Year Analysis (Q4 FY25 vs. Q4 FY24): Total Income grew by 3%. A bar chart would effectively visualize this change. PAT increased by 15%. A bar chart could also illustrate this change. The primary drivers for these changes include the company\u0027s risk-calibrated disbursement strategy, growth in secured asset disbursements in segments like Farmer Finance and Home Loans/LAP, and the utilization of macro-prudential provisions to offset increased credit costs in the microfinance segment."

A bar chart comparing FY25 and FY24 revenues would visually represent this growth.\nProfitability: PAT increased by 14% YoY.  Operating margins (NIM \u002B Fees) decreased slightly by 7 bps YoY to 10.59%.  A line chart showing NIM \u002B Fees over FY25 would highlight this trend. Key influencing factors include book mix changes, a risk-calibrated disbursement strategy, and the utilization of macro-prudential provisions."

    "segment_geographic_deep_dive": "Rural Business Finance faced challenges due to a new ordinance in Karnataka impacting collection efficiencies, though other states performed well and the company expects normalization by early Q2 FY26. Farmer Finance performed strongly, driven by a favorable monsoon and optimal rural liquidity. Urban Finance experienced growth, with Personal Loans achieving the highest ever quarterly disbursement, driven by DSA channel expansion and fintech partnerships.  SME Finance also demonstrated strong growth. Two-wheeler Finance saw tempered disbursements due to a focus on prime customers and risk-adjusted returns, with plans to recalibrate upwards in the coming quarters.",
    "deal_wins_pipeline_quality": "No specific quantitative data on deal wins or TCV was provided in the documents.

They anticipate a return to growth trajectory in the microfinance business from Q1 FY26, further accelerating in H2 FY26.  Growth in all lines of business will be a key priority, with a risk-calibrated approach.  NIM \u002B Fees is expected to be in the 10-10.5% range.  Return on Assets is projected to be between 2.4% and 2.5% for FY26, with sequential improvement in the second half, driven by declining credit costs and operating efficiencies. Management remains cautious about geopolitical risks and notes that the guidance does not account for unforeseen developments.",
